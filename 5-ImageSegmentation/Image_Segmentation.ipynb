This may be used to isolate features and identify edges.

    "**Explanation**: Using a rapid, minimal tree structure-based clustering on the picture grid, creates an over-segmentation of a multichannel image. The parameter scale determines the level of observation. Less and larger parts are associated with a greater scale. The diameter of a Gaussian kernel is sigma, which is used to smooth the picture before segmentation. Scale is the sole way to control the quantity of generated segments as well as their size. The size of individual segments within a picture might change dramatically depending on local contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other supervised and unsupervised image segmentation techniques. This can be useful in confining individual features, foreground isolation, noise reduction, and can be useful to analyze an image more intuitively. It is a good practice for images to be segmented before building a neural network model in order to yield effective results. \n",
